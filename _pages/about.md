We are a group of academics, researchers and aviation people, enthusiastic about open data. So much so that we created **Open Science Alliance for ATM**. Big words to describe the need for open data and tools in bettering the air traffic management research. 

To enable this, we created this website to share information about all the open data and open-source initiatives related to aviation.

This space is supposed to be yours. Feel free to contribute and add you name to the list:

- [@xoolive](https://github.com/xoolive). I like maps 🌍, code 🐍 and data visualisation 😎. I keep an eye on anything that can fly 🛩️.
- [@junzis](https://github.com/junzis/). I am an assistant professor at TU Delft. Most of my research is about air traffic management and aircraft surveillance: it often involves lots of data.
- [@espinielli](https://github.com/espinielli/). Interested in dataviz and looking forward to a world where human brains are freed from boring, repetitive, manual, click-copy-paste tasks.
- [@tanja-bolic](https://github.com/tanja-bolic). I am Senior Research Fellow at University of Westminster, working on air traffic management and aviation research. Good research depends on lots, and lots of data 😎.
