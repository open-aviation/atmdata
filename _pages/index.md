## Open Science Alliance for ATM Research

Open Science Alliance for Air Traffic Management (ATM) is a community dedicated to practising open science in ATM, for which the open and accessible data is the foundation. Openness and reproducibility are two sides of
the same coin and can enable trust, flexibility, and ensure the positive developments in the ATM research. The Alliance is supported by [EUROCONTROL's Performance Review Commission](https://www.eurocontrol.int/air-navigation-services-performance-review), [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/), [SESAR Joint Undertaking's Scientific Committee](https://www.sesarju.eu/about-sesar/scientific-committee), and [Engage 2 KTN project](https://engagektn.eu/) (check out the [Engage wiki](https://wikiengagektn.com/)). What is more important, it is open to anyone interested in furthering the ATM research. 

This website is a part of the Open Science Alliance community, building on the existing resources, and providing a means for continuous engagement and growth. 

## Background

This website serves as a comprehensive repository of aviation-related data initiatives, with a focus on open data sources. It is maintained by a collaborative community of aviation professionals, academics, and researchers dedicated to leveraging data-driven approaches to advance aviation technology, safety, and efficiency.

The data sources listed on this website cover a wide range of topics, including:
- air traffic management data
- operation and schedule data
- aircraft and performance data
- airport and airspace data
- aircraft surveillance data
- weather and environment data
